## Production Notes

### Universal Guidelines (All 3 Videos)

**Visual Style:**
- Portrait orientation (9:16 aspect ratio)
- Clean, minimal UI overlays
- Use device frames for professionalism
- Show real hands/faces (builds authenticity)

**Text Overlays:**
- Large, readable sans-serif font (SF Pro or similar)
- High contrast (white text on dark app footage works well)
- 1-2 seconds minimum display time per text
- Align text to top or bottom to avoid blocking important visuals

**Audio Considerations:**
- Silent version (default) - rely on text overlays
- Optional voiceover version for ads/social media
- Keep app's ambient sounds subtle in background
- No music that could conflict with app's calm vibe

**Legal/Compliance:**
- Show app icon and name clearly
- Display price prominently
- Include "Parent Gate protected" or similar security indicator
- No medical/developmental claims without disclaimers

### Post-Production Checklist

- [ ] Color grade for warmth and calm (avoid cold blues)
- [ ] Ensure all text is readable on mobile devices
- [ ] Add subtle fade transitions between scenes (300-500ms)
- [ ] Verify aspect ratio matches App Store requirements
- [ ] Export in highest quality H.264 format
- [ ] File size under 500MB per video
- [ ] Test on actual device before submission

- Format: MP4 or MOV
- Codec: H.264
- Frame rate: 30fps minimum
- Duration: 15-30 seconds each

### Alternative Approaches
